##  Overview

This is a fully custom, hand-crafted HTML/CSS/JS portfolio built without templates — everything from the animations to the overlays to the pop-ups is intentionally designed to give a smooth, divine, snowy-mountain aesthetic.

The portfolio introduces Suhani, showcases her projects, skills, education, and provides animated interactive elements such as tilt cards, snow layers, theme toggles, and dynamic pop-ups.
